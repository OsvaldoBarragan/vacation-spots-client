<h1>Vacation Spots</h1>
<p>This API gives developers a template for users, locations, and reviews. Using this API, I was able to create a website that allows users to create their own locations and let other users rate them.<p>

Technologies Used: Javascript, HTML, CSS, jQuery

<p><b>User Stories:</b></p>
<p>As a user, I want to be able to choose a location.</p>
<p>As a user, I want to read about different locations.</p>
<p>As a user, I want to be able to save a location to my wishlist.</p>
<p>As a user, I want to be able to create an account.<p>
<p>As a user, I want to save my favorite locations to a favorites list.</p>

<b>Planning:</b> My plan for this project was always starting on the API and continuing on it until every model and route worked perfectly. From there, I would work on the front-end, action by action, until I got the results I wanted. If I got stuck, I would research the problem online. If that didn't work, I would ask for help.

<b>Unsolved Problems:</b>
<p>As stated in the user stories, I still want to add the ability for users to favorite locations that they enjoy. Another problem that I still have is that the CSS is not the most attractive to most users. I will be fixing these problems soon.</p>
